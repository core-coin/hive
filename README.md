Hive is a system for running integration tests against Core Blockchain clients.

### Contributions

This project takes a different approach to code contributions than your usual FOSS project
with well ingrained maintainers and relatively few external contributors. It is an
experiment. Whether it will work out or not is for the future to decide.

We follow the [Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)][c4], code contribution model,
as expanded and explained in [The ZeroMQ Process][zmq-process]. The core idea being that
any patch that successfully solves an issue (bug/feature) and doesn't break any existing
code/contracts must be optimistically merged by maintainers. Followup patches may be used
for additional polishes – and patches may even be outright reverted if they turn out to
have a negative impact – but no change must be rejected based on personal values.
